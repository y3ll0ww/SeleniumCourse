wait = new FluentWait<>(driver) ...:

This creates a FluentWait instance. Fluent waits are a type of explicit wait in Selenium that allow you to specify more advanced conditions for waiting.
The withTimeout method sets the maximum time the fluent wait should wait for a certain condition to be satisfied.
The pollingEvery method specifies the interval at which the fluent wait will check for the condition.
The ignoring method specifies exceptions to ignore while waiting. In your case, it's set to ignore NoSuchElementException which is a common exception that occurs when an element is not immediately found.
